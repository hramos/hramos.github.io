> They bypass the iPhone's browser and use Apple's JavaScript interpreter (JavaScriptCore) directly. All graphics are rendered with OpenGL and sound with OpenAL.

OK, this is a pretty cool trick.

This approach represents an interesting alternative to traditional iOS development methods. Instead of using web views or native Objective-C/Swift code, developers can leverage JavaScript while still getting native performance through direct access to JavaScriptCore, OpenGL for graphics, and OpenAL for audio.

The technique opens up possibilities for JavaScript developers to create high-performance iOS applications without having to learn entirely new programming languages or frameworks, while still maintaining the performance benefits of native rendering.
