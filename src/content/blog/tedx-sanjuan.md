Quick heads up: tomorrow, the city of San Juan will be hosting Puerto Rico’s first TEDx event. We’ve been working behind the scenes for seven months, from picking out the venue, to holding speaker nominations and going through attendee applications. It’s kind of hard to believe that the day is already upon us. TEDx SanJuan is taking place tomorrow, December 9th, 2011.

Although tickets are no longer available, we’re happy to announce that we will be streaming TEDx San Juan live, starting at 8 AM EST tomorrow morning. Please join us for just over a half day of TEDx talks and artistic performances.
