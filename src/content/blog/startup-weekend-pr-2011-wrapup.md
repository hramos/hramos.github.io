This past weekend, Puerto Rico had its first official [Startup Weekend](http://puertorico.startupweekend.org/) event. The premise was simple: launch a startup in 54 hours.

Over 50 passionate designers, developers, business development and creatives met on Friday night and pitched dozens of ideas. They assembled into seven teams with the goal of developing a business model and prototype by Sunday evening to pitch to angel investors and venture capitalists.

The event was hosted by the team from Seriously Creative, with organizers Giovanni Collazo, Josï¿½ Padilla, Ramphis Castro, and Marcos Polanco. A team of advisers and mentors was available to help teams with product development, marketing, design, legal assistance, and business model development.
