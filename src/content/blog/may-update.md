Two big releases this week. Liberty Cablevision has launched their new iPhone app, which was developed in partnership with Polsense. I’m really proud of what we’ve done with this app, from start to finish.

I’ve also been working nights and weekends on another app that saw the light this week: EyeTour. From the makers of Puerto Rico’s premier video guide, the EyeTour iPhone app helps you explore the island of Puerto Rico on the go.

Both projects have been a huge part of my life for the last year. I hope you enjoy them. There’s more coming real soon. Polsense has been working on another iOS application for the last six weeks, but we are not ready to say more at the moment. I’m also working on another iOS app, which reminds me: TEDxSanJuan will take place this Fall. We’re working on getting the final website up and running, but until then, TEDxSanJuan Speaker Nominations ARE OPEN.
