If you’re in Puerto Rico for the weekend of October the 14th, be sure to check out Startup Weekend Puerto Rico. You’ll have just 54 hours to build a business by teaming up with entrepreneurial people from various backgrounds.

Startup Weekend is being organized by my friends Giovanni Collazo, José Padilla, Ramphis Castro, and Marcos Polanco. This core team is heavily involved in pushing Puerto Rico hard towards entrepreneurship. And what better place to exercise your product marketing, design and development muscle than Seriously Creative, an amazing space built specifically for nurturing ideas and helping teams rally into action.

Tickets for Startup Weekend are only $75 through today. You may also sponsor one lucky entrepreneur for $100. Sponsors can feed these hungry entrepreneurs for $500, or go big for $950. Enough talking, who can actually execute? We’ll see come October 14.
