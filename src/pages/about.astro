			<h2>In the past</h2>
			<p>
				Most recently a <strong
					>founding engineer at <a href="https://groupthink.com">Groupthink</a
					></strong
				>, where I built real-time AI collaboration tools in React and React
				Native and shaped our mobile and client architecture.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Worked on the React Native team at Meta</strong>, leading
				strategy for the New Architecture open source rollout. I helped shape
				the public roadmap, maintained the CI/CD pipeline, built core
				integrations, and ensured alignment between internal systems and open
				source releases. I also authored much of the documentation and worked
				closely with the community to drive adoption and developer success.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Founding engineer at Parse</strong> (acquired by Meta), where I led
				community engagement, shaped the developer advocacy roadmap, and contributed
				to both frontend and platform tooling. I also managed the Developer Advocacy
				team, gave talks worldwide, and helped guide the product through shutdown
				and open-sourcing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before that, I spent two years at Polsense <strong
					>building iOS apps in Objective-C for Puerto Rico's largest bank</strong
				>, starting just after the launch of the App Store. It was the early
				days of mobile, and I dove deep into iOS before most companies took it
				seriously, shaping internal banking tools for one of the island's
				largest institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier still, I spent four years as a <strong
					>systems architect at Evertec</strong
				>, the financial services provider behind the largest bank in Puerto
				Rico. I designed and maintained high-availability systems in a regulated
				environment, giving me a strong foundation in reliability and scale.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>I studied Computer Engineering in Puerto Rico</strong>, where I
				also managed the physics department's high-performance computing lab â€”
				an experience that grounded my love for Unix systems and infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico</strong>, a territory of
				the United States (yes, I am a citizen!). A few years after graduating
				from college, I moved to the Bay Area to build software with great
				teams.
