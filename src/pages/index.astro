			Héctor has spent his career building developer tools that change how
			entire ecosystems ship software. A computer engineer with 20 years of
			experience across infrastructure, mobile, and AI, he spent a decade at
			Meta working on open source development for React Native. Before that, he
			was one of the earliest team members at Parse (acquired by Meta/Facebook),
			where he shaped developer advocacy and built brand awareness for one of
			the fastest-growing developer tools of all time.

		<p class="text-2xl max-w-2xl font-light leading-normal">
			Today, he’s founder and CEO of Wallfacer, the cross-platform control plane
			for AI-driven software development. Wallfacer gives small teams the
			ability to direct and audit hundreds of AI coding agents with the same
			rigor Fortune 500 companies apply to human engineers — turning five-person
			startups into engineering orgs that operate like 500.
		</p>
		<p class="text-2xl max-w-2xl font-light leading-normal">
			Before Wallfacer, Héctor was a founding engineer at Groupthink, building
			real-time AI collaboration tools in React and React Native. Originally
			from Puerto Rico, he’s now based in Scottsdale, where he still tinkers
			with systems for fun — from a backyard observatory for deep-sky
			astrophotography to a rooftop plane tracker.
